# Preview Image Note

The preview.png image should be a screenshot of the Astra Learn landing page.

## To Create:

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Take a full-page screenshot of the landing page
4. Crop/resize to 1920x1080 or similar
5. Save as `public/preview.png`

## Alternative:
Use browser dev tools screenshot feature:
